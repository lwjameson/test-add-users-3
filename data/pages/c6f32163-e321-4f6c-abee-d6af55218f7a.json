She begins with a paradox: [2] “In order to become orientated, you might suppose that we must first experience disorientation. When we are orientated, we might not even notice that we are orientated: we might not even think ‘to think’ about this point.”  Ahmed’s depiction of orientation implies that disorientation – and thus awareness of orientation – is a part of queer experience; queerness is, by definition, at odds with societal defaults, resulting in constant reminders of difference and pressure to conform."

          "text": "During the 1950s, when Elizabeth Bishop began her long partnership with Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, queerness was referred to as “deviation” and “inversion,” both of which suggest a straying from the “straight” path. Bishop famously quipped that she liked, “closets, closets, and more closets,” and although her friends knew she was queer, she remained circumspect about her sexual orientation in her public and professional life. Even in letters to her longtime editor at The New Yorker, Bishop referred to Lota as “her friend” or “the friend she was staying with” in Brazil. Given her reticence about her private life, Bishop’s poetry does not directly address her queerness – only obliquely, as in her poem “The Shampoo” about washing Lota’s greying hair in a tin tub – and even then, not often. Her evasiveness gives some of her poems an elliptical movement in which the compositions constantly turn in on themselves rather than being directed outward toward a figure of the beloved. "

Thomas Travisano identifies a kind of queer poetics in Bishop’s deflections that matches the queer phenomenological orientations that Ahmed describes. [3] As Travisano notes, “…these poems invite us to consider the obliquities of self-reference so frequent in her published canon, even in poems not directly or obviously referencing sexuality.”  "

But Bishop’s queerness does not only appear through elision or evasiveness – the inward movement that Travisano describes. The turns, and in particular the resolutions, of her poems exhibit queer reorientations. [4] When faced with choices in her poems, Bishop rejects binaries altogether. Instead, she reorients away from prescribed dichotomies by embracing hybridity, porousness, and dissolution. "

[7] Unlike the poem “Exchanging Hats,” in which “Unfunny uncles” “insist / in trying on a lady’s hat,” Bishop does not engage – even obliquely – with the possibility of gender fluidity. The shamans she lists in “The Riverman” are all male, and the speaker does not channel any spirits, only meets them."

This figure is described in both animal and human terms, at first grunting and then sighing. From the earliest drafts, Bishop attributes hybridity to these magical beings who can cross between worlds. As the riverman spends more time underwater, he undergoes a transformation, turning both yellow and cold-blooded, and he reports, “There is fine mud on my scalp / and I know from smelling my comb / that the river smells in my hair.”  Rather than living on either land or in water, he pursues a dual orientation."

The riverman can access every space but does not belong in any of them. He lives in a constant state of reorientation."

[11] The poem begins, “Hidden, oh hidden / in the high fog / the house we live in, / beneath the magnetic rock, / rain- rainbow-ridden.” The landscape surrounds and protects the house, giving a feeling of enclosure and separation from the outside world.

The vapor that rises from this “thick growth” behaves not like breath from lungs but another form of protective enclosure, “holding them both, / house and rock.”  Bishop repeatedly connects fog with breath in this poem and then imbues respiration with additional power. Breath envelops the home and landscape in a blanket of safety. Later, within the home, a map is “darkened and tarnished / by the warm touch / of the warm breath.”  Once again, breath assumes a comforting, physical form, distinguished here by its warmth, and impacts the surrounding environment by causing a living map to spread along a wall of the house."

The sunlight is so non-threatening that it appears “kind.” Then, instead of continuing the cozy descriptions, the house opens to vermin like silverfish and bookworms. "

However, when Robert Lowell complimented Bishop upon the poem’s publication, she replied with her thanks but asserted that “there are some words that must be changed, somehow.”  She incorporated these changes in the version that appears in her collection Questions of Travel. The most significant revision to the poem’s text is in this line,  in which the house becomes open “to membership,” and the creatures that one normally aims to exclude instead join the household. Even the mildew is offered a wall for its “ignorant map.” Nature, while plentiful both inside and outside of the house, acts within the obscurity of the fog and vapor, between the “blind” raindrops on the roof and this map that is shaped by “warm breath” but represents something unknown."

The speaker and the moving boat from which the speaker observes this kaleidoscope of sun, rain, river, and rainbow are not introduced until the poem’s halfway point. Instead, Bishop concentrates on a moment at which “the world, all pink, / has dissolved,” varying and repeating lines. This moment of dissolution is also one of epiphany: “the world … has dissolved at last / and is going somewhere, at last – so that is the color of the world all together / just water / and a little sun / and a gentle acquiescent world.” At this moment, there is no struggle, no conflict, only simple acceptance.

The repetition of “dissolution” in “On the Amazon” illustrates Bishop’s preoccupation with the concept, and it appears one last time in “Santarém” as a way of finally collapsing binaries and instead focusing on meeting and allowing the space between seemingly disparate elements to exist."
