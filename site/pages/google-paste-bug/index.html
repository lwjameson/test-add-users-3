These classes were attended by Anzaldua, showing a deep interest in the Tarot. Anzaldua demonstrates her knowledge by giving a tarot reading in 1981 to Sally Gearhart[MO2] , an activist[MO3] , novelist, professor active in San Francisco, and co-author of A Feminist Tarot (1981), along with Susan Rennie. In many of the recordings, Anzaldua receives either palm, astrology, or tarot readings. In one such recording, Anzaldua’s palms are read by her friend and fellow scholar Chela Sandoval while Anzaldua visited her in Santa Cruz in July 1983.

In this way, AVAnnotate can be used as a tool to preserve transcripts as an alternate mode of access, to augment the researcher experience by providing archival connections between audiovisual materials and other objects in a collection, and to document the materials themselves, beyond the level of the transcript, to include knowledge that might only be gleaned from interacting with the materials in their original formats.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; It can also support the incorporation of humanistic knowledge.

She begins with a paradox: [2] “In order to become orientated, you might suppose that we must first experience disorientation. When we are orientated, we might not even notice that we are orientated: we might not even think ‘to think’ about this point.”  Ahmed’s depiction of orientation implies that disorientation – and thus awareness of orientation – is a part of queer experience; queerness is, by definition, at odds with societal defaults, resulting in constant reminders of difference and pressure to conform.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;During the 1950s, when Elizabeth Bishop began her long partnership with Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares, queerness was referred to as “deviation” and “inversion,” both of which suggest a straying from the “straight” path. Bishop famously quipped that she liked, “closets, closets, and more closets,” and although her friends knew she was queer, she remained circumspect about her sexual orientation in her public and professional life. Even in letters to her longtime editor at The New Yorker, Bishop referred to Lota as “her friend” or “the friend she was staying with” in Brazil. Given her reticence about her private life, Bishop’s poetry does not directly address her queerness – only obliquely, as in her poem “The Shampoo” about washing Lota’s greying hair in a tin tub – and even then, not often. Her evasiveness gives some of her poems an elliptical movement in which the compositions constantly turn in on themselves rather than being directed outward toward a figure of the beloved. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This inward reorientation occurs during the revision process, as several of Bishop’s first drafts directly refer to her partners, and these references were removed as she prepared work for publication. Thomas Travisano identifies a kind of queer poetics in Bishop’s deflections that matches the queer phenomenological orientations that Ahmed describes. [3] As Travisano notes, “…these poems invite us to consider the obliquities of self-reference so frequent in her published canon, even in poems not directly or obviously referencing sexuality.”  &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Ahmed’s precipitating observation that one only requires orientation if previously disoriented offers a fresh way to interpret both Bishop’s frequent displacements and the often-elliptical nature of her writing. But Bishop’s queerness does not only appear through elision or evasiveness – the inward movement that Travisano describes. The turns, and in particular the resolutions, of her poems exhibit queer reorientations. [4] When faced with choices in her poems, Bishop rejects binaries altogether. Instead, she reorients away from prescribed dichotomies by embracing hybridity, porousness, and dissolution. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Riverman – hybridity&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;[5] The first poem I will discuss is “The Riverman,” a dramatic monologue about an indigenous man who lives in the Amazon region and who becomes a shaman, or witch-doctor. Bishop wrote the poem based on an anthropological study called Amazon Town: A Study of Man in the Tropics by Charles Wagley, and she fictionalizes a shaman named Satiro who is described in the book, giving him the powers that he hopes to one day acquire.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The original description of Satiro in Amazon Town offers rich possibilities for telling a queer narrative. [6] Wagley recounts a moment when Satiro, during a healing ceremony, is possessed by a spirit, who “was obviously a female, because he began to sing in high falsetto and his movements were dainty.”  This altered manner lasts until the healing session ends, and the spirit departs his body. [7] Unlike the poem “Exchanging Hats,” in which “Unfunny uncles” “insist / in trying on a lady’s hat,” Bishop does not engage – even obliquely – with the possibility of gender fluidity. The shamans she lists in “The Riverman” are all male, and the speaker does not channel any spirits, only meets them.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; “The Riverman” does have two women characters: the wife who belongs to the mundane, surface world and Luandinha, the snake-shaped goddess who reigns below the Amazon. These women represent multiple, rather conventional dualities: water/land, nature/society, and travel/home. However, the riverman does not choose between them.

This figure is described in both animal and human terms, at first grunting and then sighing. From the earliest drafts, Bishop attributes hybridity to these magical beings who can cross between worlds. As the riverman spends more time underwater, he undergoes a transformation, turning both yellow and cold-blooded, and he reports, “There is fine mud on my scalp / and I know from smelling my comb / that the river smells in my hair.”  Rather than living on either land or in water, he pursues a dual orientation.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Despite his developing magic, the riverman quickly learns the limitations of his hybridity.

He cannot identify magical spirits without the help of a virgin mirror, but every time he reaches for one at the local shop, “a neighbor looked over my shoulder / and then that one was spoiled –.”  Becoming part fish, he no longer consumes it, and his wife worries about his color and coldness.

Hybridity, it appears, generates its own problems, which arise at the intersection of the worlds, when one side of his life intrudes on the other. The riverman can access every space but does not belong in any of them. He lives in a constant state of reorientation.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Song for the Rainy Season – Porousness&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;[9] While hybridity offers one form of queer reorientation, Bishop also expresses other queer ways of being in both time and space. Ahmed states that [10] “If orientation is a matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence; of how we inhabit spaces…” Phenomenologically, residence and inhabitation can apply to the physical body and to the surrounding space, and, as always, there’s a constant exchange between the body that inhabits and changes the space it occupies and the surrounding space that shapes and affects the body. There’s a perpetual setting and redefinition of boundaries.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; The focus on boundaries and their potential porousness is typical of Bishop’s work.

Lota, an architect, designed the home, and at times they camped in a partially finished house as it was constructed around them. [11] The poem begins, “Hidden, oh hidden / in the high fog / the house we live in, / beneath the magnetic rock, / rain- rainbow-ridden.” The landscape surrounds and protects the house, giving a feeling of enclosure and separation from the outside world. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The “brook sings,” and a voice emerges “from a rib cage / of giant fern.”  Samambaia, the name of the home, means giant fern, so Bishop directly references the house she shared with Lota in the poem. The vapor that rises from this “thick growth” behaves not like breath from lungs but another form of protective enclosure, “holding them both, / house and rock.”  Bishop repeatedly connects fog with breath in this poem and then imbues respiration with additional power. Breath envelops the home and landscape in a blanket of safety. Later, within the home, a map is “darkened and tarnished / by the warm touch / of the warm breath.”  Once again, breath assumes a comforting, physical form, distinguished here by its warmth, and impacts the surrounding environment by causing a living map to spread along a wall of the house.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Despite the secret, closed sensation that is established from the opening lines of the poem, the house itself is “open,” [12] as are the sounds: “House, open house.” Landscape and home merge further, where the house is not only embedded in the terrain but welcoming of “the white dew / and the milk-white sunrise,”  which is muted by the surrounding fog and vapor. The sunlight is so non-threatening that it appears “kind.” Then, instead of continuing the cozy descriptions, the house opens to vermin like silverfish and bookworms. &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The two published versions of this poem differ in how the house receives these new occupants. [13] In The New Yorker, the house is “too indulgent, perhaps” of the various vermin who enter, which suggests that they should, perhaps, be prohibited from entering the space. However, when Robert Lowell complimented Bishop upon the poem’s publication, she replied with her thanks but asserted that “there are some words that must be changed, somehow.”  She incorporated these changes in the version that appears in her collection Questions of Travel. The most significant revision to the poem’s text is in this line,  in which the house becomes open “to membership,” and the creatures that one normally aims to exclude instead join the household. Even the mildew is offered a wall for its “ignorant map.” Nature, while plentiful both inside and outside of the house, acts within the obscurity of the fog and vapor, between the “blind” raindrops on the roof and this map that is shaped by “warm breath” but represents something unknown.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;As in “The Riverman,” there’s a certain merging that takes place in this poem; however, rather than imagining a hybrid space, this home is porous – to a certain extent. It is open to all guests, and yet it is closed away from the rest of the world in this remote, hidden place where the first-person plural “we” and “us” live “our small shadowy / life” alongside animals, waterfalls, and lush vegetation.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;If this porousness indicates a queer space, what about queer time? Here the poem also deviates from an expected, linear path. The temporal scale of the poem constantly shifts, as the second stanza invokes “a dim age / of water,” which sounds prehistoric. The speaker and companion disappear, and instead the landscape is given a voice and body, with the vapor embracing both the house and rock. Then water droplets climb “[a]t night, on the roof,” returning the temporal measurement to human-scale before swerving once more into deep time, as the mildew’s map is celebrated for capturing the present, as “a later / era will differ.” &quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The poem leaps eons into the future, and epochal weight bears down upon transitory human lives. The map on the wall, although “ignorant” and not an accurate representation of any particular place, offers a snapshot of the present moment. The mildew will, presumably, grow and change over time, and this record of the passage of time has value. [14] The lines about change and the way it overshadows shared, small lives is set aside within parentheses, enclosing them within the larger structure of the poem, both protecting and separating this truth from the passage of time.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\t[15] The poem then simultaneously unravels the opening while continuing to circumscribe it. The water in this future era disappears, and the “magnetic rock” becomes “unmagnetized, bare,” while the “rain-, rainbow-ridden” space is “no longer wearing / rainbows or rain.”  The pairing of these opening and closing lines acts like parentheses enclosing the microcosm of Samambaia with the house and the vermin and the landscape within; yet the final lines undo this effect as every closing is also a reversal or undoing. The ample water disappears, and the owls “will move on.” Eventually the “waterfalls shrivel / in the steady sun.”&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\tWhile the house and the landscape have porous boundaries, allowing for an exchange of elements and inhabitants, time makes the landscape itself porous.

As a third technique, she also dissolves binaries altogether. [17] Her best-known poem of dissolution is probably her late poem “Santarém,” which begins with a choice, represented by the “conflux of two great rivers, Tapajós, Amazon.” As she writes, “Even if one were tempted / to literary interpretations / such as: life/death, right/wrong, male/female / ---such notions would have resolved, dissolved, straight off / in that watery, dazzling dialectic.”&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;While Santarém provides an obvious example of dissolution, I’d like to look at a draft of an earlier, unfinished poem, “On the Amazon” [18] as it addresses issues of orientation more directly. At the start of the poem there is no fixed perspective. Instead, the fragment begins with its repetition of directional words that move “down,” “forward,” “down,” “everywhere,” “backwards,” “over there,” “crossing over,” and “going somewhere” in a joyful, colorful disorientation. The speaker and the moving boat from which the speaker observes this kaleidoscope of sun, rain, river, and rainbow are not introduced until the poem’s halfway point. Instead, Bishop concentrates on a moment at which “the world, all pink, / has dissolved,” varying and repeating lines. This moment of dissolution is also one of epiphany: “the world … has dissolved at last / and is going somewhere, at last – so that is the color of the world all together / just water / and a little sun / and a gentle acquiescent world.” At this moment, there is no struggle, no conflict, only simple acceptance. Dissolution brings clarity and peace.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;[19] Then, as if the emotion becomes too extravagant, the poem is reorientated, and the speaker is introduced: “The river, we are told, goes faster than the ship.” Bishop juxtaposes the movement of the river with a static, souvenir shop stuffed crocodile and spends the remainder of this fragment attempting to situate the boat in relation to the water and whatever they pass: a line of birds, a bar on stilts, a bird on stilts, a boy on stilts. At this point, the draft itself loses direction. The gap between the two modes is simply too large.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The climax of this poem occurs at the moment of dissolution, when orientation loses meaning and the world simply is. The concept of dissolution recurs in Bishop’s poetry, beginning with “The Imaginary Iceberg” where “the ship’s sails were laid upon the sea / as the snow lies undissolved upon the water.”  It appears again in “Paris, 7 A.M.” and “Quai d’Orléans,” both times in an eerie, somewhat surreal scene. The repetition of “dissolution” in “On the Amazon” illustrates Bishop’s preoccupation with the concept, and it appears one last time in “Santarém” as a way of finally collapsing binaries and instead focusing on meeting and allowing the space between seemingly disparate elements to exist.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;[20] Ahmed states, “Orientation involves aligning body and space: we only know

The recordings, most of which were recorded on audiocassette by Anzaldua herself, were made between 1980 and 1984 and document the writer’s interest in occult spiritual practices as methods of learning and knowing, what would inform a sense of what Anzaldua refers to as Spiritual Activism.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> The early 1980s are a critical period in the study of Anzaldua’s life and work, with the 1981 publication of the landmark Feminist anthology, This Bridge Called My Back [MO1] which was co-edited by Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrié Moraga and published by Kitchen Table Press. It was during this time that Anzaldua was working on Borderlands/La Frontera (1987).</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> Evidenced in these recordings are not only Anzaldua’s interest in what we might readily identify as “New Age” spiritual practice, such as tarot, palmistry, and astrology, but the networks of spiritual practitioners, scholars, and activists that Anzaldua interacted with while living and writing in the cultural hotbeds of San Francisco and later, New York.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> Audiovisual materials provide unique insights into history. Through the voices and conversations captured in this collection of recordings, listeners may come closer to understanding the particular ways in which histories were first embodied in their own present time. Laughter, silence, pauses and hesitations, the crunching sounds of mixed nuts, creaking doors, and detours in conversation: these artifacts within artifacts carry meaning that can only be interpreted in real time, while also revealing the imperfections and spontaneity of the historical process.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> </p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">This exhibit serves to index recurring themes within the collection, while also pointing to related areas and artifacts of the broader Anzaldua Papers, including manuscripts, subject files, and other audiovisual materials.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Description of the Recordings</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">There are over 300 audiocassette tapes in Anzaldua’s collection. Described in the Benson’s finding aid as “Spirituality Recordings,” these 16 audio recordings document palm readings, astrology readings, and tarot readings and workshops. Many of the recordings prominently feature Anzaldua as she receives readings; other figures that appear in the recordings include Cherrie Moraga, Chela Sandoval, Angeles Arrien, and Sally Gearhart.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> The earliest recordings in this exhibit were made in the late Summer of 1980, and document a series of tarot workshops taught by Angeles Arrien, a cultural anthropologist and author of ten books including The Tarot handbook : practical applications of ancient visual symbols (1987), and The Four-Fold Way: Walking the Paths of the Warrior, Healer, Teacher and Visionary (1993). These classes were attended by Anzaldua, showing a deep interest in the Tarot. Anzaldua demonstrates her knowledge by giving a tarot reading in 1981 to Sally Gearhart[MO2] , an activist[MO3] , novelist, professor active in San Francisco, and co-author of A Feminist Tarot (1981), along with Susan Rennie. In many of the recordings, Anzaldua receives either palm, astrology, or tarot readings. In one such recording, Anzaldua’s palms are read by her friend and fellow scholar Chela Sandoval while Anzaldua visited her in Santa Cruz in July 1983. In another undated recording, Cherrie Moraga receives an astrology reading from an unidentified practitioner.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">About this Exhibit and Using AVAnnotate to Access Archival Materials</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">This AVAnnotate exhibit is intended to foreground the value of audiovisual materials held in archives collections that may go understudied, especially when compared to paper artifacts. By annotating passages with artifacts from the Anzaldua Papers that are relevant either thematically or historically, this exhibit might serve as a jumping off point into what is a considerable collection with a diverse range of materials. By contextualizing these recordings among the broader collection, we can see just how intertwined Anzaldua’s spiritual practices were with her scholarship, her writing process, and her role within a larger community of scholars, teachers, writers, and activists.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> One benefit of using the AVAnnotate platform to facilitate access to archival collections is the ability to integrate transcripts and annotations with the audiovisual materials themselves. In the case of legacy media, both analog and digital, preservation and conservation are critical to the survival of these materials and the knowledge encoded within them, yet it remains a struggle for many archives institutions to attend to the challenges of deterioration, maintaining hardware for playback, and/or the upkeep of maintaining unsupported software and file formats. In this way, AVAnnotate can be used as a tool to preserve transcripts as an alternate mode of access, to augment the researcher experience by providing archival connections between audiovisual materials and other objects in a collection, and to document the materials themselves, beyond the level of the transcript, to include knowledge that might only be gleaned from interacting with the materials in their original formats.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> It can also support the incorporation of humanistic knowledge. For example, when original or digitized artifacts are lost or irrecoverable, annotated transcripts based on the original materials, can preserve extralinguistic meanings that may otherwise be lost.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Methods: Annotating the tapes/ A Guide to Layers and Index Terms</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">What is it like to listen to these tapes? What sort of problems arise when trying to annotate audiovisual/time-based materials?  Patterns, experiences, questions.</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">What standards have I employed in this project and what do my annotations accomplish? How can they be used? What problems do the annotations address?</p>  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">Example: How language is captured.
